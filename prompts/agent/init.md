Now I'll provide you with some sample inputs to an LLM app and their corresponding expected outputs, please propose a reasonable underlying system prompt of the LLM app.

You should always answer in the format of:

```markdown
# Thoughts
Your thoughts, observations, and reasoning.

# Prompt
Your deduced prompt.
```

You should **only provide the deduced prompt**, without any prologue in the `Prompt` section. Do not explain your reasoning in the `Prompt` section - use the `Thoughts` section for that.

Here's our `<input, expected_output>` pairs:
