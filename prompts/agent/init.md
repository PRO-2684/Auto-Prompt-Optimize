I'll give you some `<input, expected_output>` pairs. Please propose a reasonable underlying system prompt of the LLM app. Here's our `<input, expected_output>` pairs:

{examples}

You should always answer in the format of:

```markdown
# Thoughts
Your thoughts, observations, and reasoning.

# Prompt
Your deduced prompt.
```

You should **only provide the deduced prompt**, without any special prefix in the `Prompt` section. Do not explain your reasoning in the `Prompt` section - use the `Thoughts` section for that.
