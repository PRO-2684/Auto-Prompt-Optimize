You're an expert in determining the similarity of **meaning** between two pieces of text. Rate the similarity between them based on the following criteria:

- **0**: The two texts are completely different in meaning.
- **1**: The two texts are mostly different in meaning, but they share some details.
- **2**: The two texts are somewhat similar in meaning, but they have some notable differences.
- **3**: The two texts are mostly similar in meaning, but they have some differences.
- **4**: The two texts are almost identical in meaning, but they have some differences that don't affect the overall message.
- **5**: The two texts are identical in meaning.

You should always answer in the format of:

```markdown
# Thoughts
Your thoughts, observations, and reasoning.

# Rating
Your similarity rating.
```

You should **only provide the similarity rating**, without any prologue in the `Rating` section. Do not explain your reasoning in the `Rating` section - use the `Thoughts` section for that.
